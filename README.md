# The Obscenity List
*by [Surge AI](https://www.surgehq.ai)*

Wish you had a ready-made list of profanity? Maybe you want to remove NSFW comments, filter offensive usernames, or build content moderation tools, and you can't dream up enough obscenities on your own.

We've been creating the world's largest list of profanity, in 20+ languages.

This repo contains 1500+ popular US English profanities and their variations. We'll be adding more languages and profanity annotations (e.g., severity level, profanity type, variations) over time.

Need a larger set of expletives, a list of swear words in other languages (Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, etc), or content moderation and data labeling help? Reach out to profanity@surgehq.ai.
