# The Obscene List
*brought to you by: www.surgehq.ai*

A dataset of US-English profanity, originally created in September 2021

**tl;dr**

We created a dataset of ~16k profanities in 13 languages. We made the 2k+ US-English profanities and they're variations publicly available.

Need profanities in Chinese, German, Russian, Turkish, or any other language? Reach out: profanity@surgehq.ai

**Why**

This data is essential for important work such as building community moderation tools, measuring toxic/profane speech, and managing platform abuse.
