# The Obscenity List
*by [Surge AI](https://www.surgehq.ai)*

Ever wish you had a large, ready-made list of profanity? Maybe you want to remove NSFW comments, prevent offensive usernames, build content moderation tools, or monitor toxic speech, and you can't dream up enough expletives, curses, swear words, and obscenities – in all their wondrous v4ri4ti0ns – on your own.

So we've been creating the world's largest list of profanity, in 20+ languages.

This repo contains 2000+ popular US English profanities and their variations. We'll also be adding more languages and profanity annotations (e.g., severity level, profanity type, variations) over time.

Need a larger profanity list, a list of obscenities in other languages (Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, etc), or content moderation and data labeling help? Reach out to profanity@surgehq.ai.
