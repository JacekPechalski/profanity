# profanity
Dataset of US-English profanity, originally created in September 2021

**tl;dr**
We created a dataset of ~16k profanities in 13 languages. We made the 2k+ US-English profanities and they're variations publicly available.

Need profanities in Chinese, German, Russian, Turkish, or any other language reach out: profanity@surgehq.ai

**Why**
There simply aren't good alternatives freely available and this data is essential for important work such as building community moderation tools or to measuring toxic/profane speech or managing platform abuse.
